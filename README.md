# URL-Shortner - Dependencies and Future Enhancements

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- **cookie-parser**: For parsing cookies to manage user sessions.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables such as database URIs and JWT secrets.
- **ejs**: For rendering dynamic HTML templates in the web application.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For secure user authentication through JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **mongoose**: For interacting with MongoDB, used to store and retrieve data.
- **nodemon**: For automatically restarting the server during development when changes are made.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some planned features to improve the URL-Shortner:

- **Allow users to customize the shortened URL**: Enable users to create custom shortened URLs instead of automatically generated ones.
- **Implement an analytics feature**: Track the number of clicks on each shortened URL to provide analytics on URL usage.
